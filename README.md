# About the Project
E-Commerce is the process of building a website or an online store for selling products and/or services. It allows a buyer to find their products and purchase them via a shopping cart.
 <!-- eCommerce websites usually offer a variety of online payment options. -->

## Usage
- It can help to improve your üÖ±usiness processes and information flows by enabling you to communicate with other businesses faster and more efficiently.
- If you already sell üéÅgoods or services in off-line situations (e.g. retail shops) you now have the option of selling your goods and services online to a much wider audience and at times not defined by normal trading hours.
- E-Commerce allows you to build better relationships with your üßëcustomers and find new customers as you are now üåçglobal instead of local.
